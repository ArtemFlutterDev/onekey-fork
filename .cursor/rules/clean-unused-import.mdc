# Remember
Run the command `yarn run lint` straight away, don't add anything else because you need the full information and any extra manipulation will get you out of luck. Don't run `yarn run lint | cat`.

Then you help me find @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars related warnings. Only fix unused imports, not modify function definitions or other code.

I need you to fix it for me, but there are a couple of rules to be aware of.

## Only fix three files. No any more.

## Follow [eslint.js](mdc:development/lint/eslint.js)

# rules

## You can only fix type-related ones.
```ts
import type { IAccountDeriveTypes } from '@onekeyhq/kit-bg/src/vaults/types' ;

import type {
  IAccountDeriveInfo,
  IAccountDeriveTypes
} from '@onekeyhq/kit-bg/src/vaults/types'; 
```

## You can only fix react related.
```ts
import { useCallback, useMemo, useRef, useState } from 'react';
```

## You can only fix '@onekeyhq/components' related.
```ts
import {
  Checkbox, Dialog,
  useClipboard, useForm,
  useForm
} from '@onekeyhq/components'
```

## You can only fix three of the above, and you are not allowed to change the code anywhere else.
