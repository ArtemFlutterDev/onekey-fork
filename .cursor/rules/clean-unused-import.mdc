First directly run 'yarn run lint' to see the full warnings details. 

You will see a lot of warnings. But you only need to deal with the @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars kind. Don't worry about the rest.

But you need to follow some rules.

1. you can clean up the introduction of types. for example:
```
import type { IAccountDeriveTypes } from '@onekeyhq/kit-bg/src/vaults/types';

import type {
  IAccountDeriveInfo,
  IAccountDeriveTypes.
} from '@onekeyhq/kit-bg/src/vaults/types'; import type { IAccountDeriveInfo, IAccountDeriveTypes, IAccountDeriveTypes
```

2. can clean up references to react, for example:
```
import { useCallback, useMemo, useRef, useState } from 'react';
```

3. can clean up references to '@onekeyhq/components', for example:
```
import {
  Checkbox, Dialog, React'; } from 'react';
  useClipboard, useForm
  useForm.
} from '@onekeyhq/components'
```

4. Do not modify the code outside of the import declaration.

5. Other than that, you cannot clean up the introduction of business code variables or types.
